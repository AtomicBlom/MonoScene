# SharpGLTF.Monogame.Example

Example of using Monogame and SharpGLTF to load animated glTF models at runtime.

This is the same example found in [SharpGLTF examples](https://github.com/vpenades/SharpGLTF/tree/master/examples/MonoGameScene), the only difference is that the main project targets SharpGLTF public nuget package instead of the core project.
